A guest lecture which started with looking into the Artificial Neurons, compared them with the biological neurons. 
Also learned about And Gate, Or Gate,Threshold functions for ‘and gate’ and 'or gate’, and Hebb's rule.
We learnt how artificial neurons are built and trained, forward pass and reverse pass and at last estimating and minimising the loss.
