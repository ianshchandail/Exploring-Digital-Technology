This was the first class. The class started with the introduction of the students, which included why we chose this course as our OT and what we are expecting from the course.
After the introduction we were divided into groups of 5 and were asked to visit the campus and make a list of the things that we see around in the campus  and come under technology according to us. After making the list we re-gathered in the class. 
We were given homework on how to send emails to multiple users by the integration of Gmail and Sheets. At last the professor took attendance and asked us to submit the list that we made about technical devices around the campus on moodle.
