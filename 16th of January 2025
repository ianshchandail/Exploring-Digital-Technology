This was the first class. The class started with the introduction of the students, which included why we choose this course as our OT and what are we expecting from the course.
After the introduction we were divided into groups of 5 and were asked to visit the campus and make a list of the things that we see around us and come under technology according to us.
After making the list we re-gathered in the class and the professor took the attendance and asked us to submit the list that we made on moodle.
