In this class we installed WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on our laptops by using Ubuntu.
After the installation of Linux we tried some of the basic commands, such as looking into the directories, reading new directories and deleting directories.
We also looked on how we can open apps without actually double clicking in a easy way.
